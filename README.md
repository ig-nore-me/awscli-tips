Snippets of code from the [@awscli_tips](https://twitter.com/awscli_tips) Twitter account

The snippets are separated into their own directories, organised by main subcommand (e.g. ec2) and function name (e.g. getvpcbyname). Snippets are written as functions so they can be easily sourced (e.g. `source iam/getsts/getsts.sh`).
